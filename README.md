# Reflect

Reflect is a virtual diary assistant which is a day-to-day journal but offers advice and daily inputs based on the user’s entries. It uses emotion classification to process daily diary entries to detect the user’s mood and similarly offers mindful and calming tasks based on the user’s pre-filled preferences.
